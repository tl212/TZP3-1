## TZP3-1 | Hybrid Movie Recommender System - Part 1 
### Overview 

In this project we are going to implement two of the most popular recommender engines; Content-Based Filtering &  Collaborative Filtering. 

#### Content-Based Filtering

In a content-based filtering, the similarity between different products is calculated on the basis of the attributes of the products. For instance, in a content-based movie recommender system, the similarity between the movies is calculated on the basis of genres, the actors in the movie, the director of the movie, etc.

#### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering leverages the power of the crowd. The intuition behind collaborative filtering is that if a user A likes products X and Y, and if another user B likes product X, there is a fair bit of chance that he will like the product Y as well.

#### Hybrid 

Hybrid recommenders use both user-item interaction data and their contextual information. In this work, we propose hybrid recommender algorithms by considering the relationship between content features. This relationship is embedded into the hybrid recommenders to improve their accuracy.
